I'm uploading this if anyone is interested in solving my problem and pointing out where I'm going wrong.

I can't for the life of me figure out why the collision and shader terrain aren't giving me the same height values when given the same heightmap.

I've tried several permutations, offsets, formulas and methods without success.

I want:
  - Terrain geo that is visible in editor
  - Terrain split into chunks or tiles
  - Terrain based on procedural, infinite noise
  - Terrain height being controlled by the shader assigned to it
